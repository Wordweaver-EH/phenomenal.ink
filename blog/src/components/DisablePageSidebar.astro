<!-- Disabling the page sidebar here. It has clearer intent than doing it in 
     css. If we need to bring it back, remove this file and update
     astro.config.mjs to remove the reference to this file. Sidebars could
     be removed individually in the frontmatter config.

     I've also removed the sidebars in the frontmatter for the existing pages
     so the rest of starlight's styling is aware it's gone (less css to fight.)
     
     This is...
     tableOfContents: false
