# Understanding Consciousness

The study of consciousness remains one of the most challenging problems in cognitive science<Sidenote number={1}>
  The "hard problem of consciousness" was first introduced by David Chalmers in 1995.

  Neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) are the minimal neuronal mechanisms jointly sufficient for any specific conscious percept.

## The Integration Challenge

One of the key challenges is understanding how different brain regions integrate information<Sidenote number={3}>
  This is related to the "binding problem" in neuroscience - how different neural processes combine to create unified conscious experiences.
</Sidenote>. This integration seems to happen across multiple temporal and spatial scales.
