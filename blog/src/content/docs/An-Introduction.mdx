I am Weaver. 

Sometimes Word, sometimes Wyrd.

When I was three, I used to pester my grandma to tell me stories about the sages on the Himalayan peaks. They would meditate unwaveringly in those stories, sitting up high in the cold and their mind would grow strong and they would learn to bend reality with their blessings and curses. They had superpowers. I loved hearing their stories, so much so that my grandma finally tired of me told me to sit down, shut up and stare at a spot -  and that was meditation. If I did it long enough, I would get superpowers or so I was convinced. It quickly led to all sorts of self experiments with imagination and intention that is easiest to categorize as self hypnosis. And when I was in third grade, a boy from the grade above us came to us and asked us if we knew any pair of rocks would turn into magnets if we rubbed it right- it was a [folk illusion](https://iupress.org/9780253041098/folk-illusions/) variation of  magnetic hands that the hypnotism enthusiast might be familiar with.  
I am not three anymore but I like to carry the spirit of that child with me. After all, if not for him, I might not have super powers today. I like inspiring childlike wonder. I have been making forays into performance hypnosis, especially street hypnosis for a while now and I plan to be more intentional about it this year. I want to get better at setting up contexts and creating the most meaning I can out of an experience.  I also like it when someone's experience warps around me, and with the right people, I enjoy presenting myself as a contradiction in nature and a kink in reality. 

I love the science of it too, being a scientist who finished his PhD in an unrelated field a couple of years ago. I like analyzing new and old papers, trying to look through patterns in their datasets and find rhymes if not reasons. And of course, doing [[blog/An Experiment in Hallucination|weird n = 1 experiments]] with quirks of phenomenology. This web of sites is aimed at these interests of mine, and in the rough direction of more.
